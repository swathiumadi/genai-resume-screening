# genai-resume-screening
A Generative AI project to classify resumes using Hugging Face zero-shot classification
#  GenAI Resume Classifier 

This project leverages **Generative AI (Zero-Shot Learning)** to automatically classify resumes into job roles such as Data Science, DevOps, HR, and more â€” **without any training**. It uses the powerful **`facebook/bart-large-mnli` model** from Hugging Face and runs entirely on **Google Colab** using Python.

##  Project Overview 

Recruiters often spend hours manually reading and sorting resumes. This project solves that by automating the classification using a **zero-shot classification model**, which understands and labels raw resume content without needing labeled training data.

---

##  Objectives 

- Classify resumes into predefined job categories using GenAI  
- Eliminate the need for model training (Zero-shot learning)  
- Run everything using free tools (Google Colab + Hugging Face)
